# DefAssembler - Command-line Utility
This package exports a command-line program called `defasm`, with which you can assemble and (optionally) execute Assembly source code. To use the package, install it globally with `npm install -g @defasm/core` and then run `defasm --help`.

Note that the package does *not* come with an emulator. When executing, the assembled code is saved into an ELF file, linked, and then executed directly. As such, the command-line utility is currently functional only on systems that support ELF files (e.g. Linux).

## Options
* `-i`, `--intel` - use Intel syntax when assembling (defaults to AT&T)
* `-l PATH`, `--linker PATH` - set the linker to use before executing (only relevant if `--run` is provided; defaults to `ld`)
* `-o FILE`, `--output FILE` - set the path to the output file (defaults to 'a.out' in the current directory, or /tmp/asm.out if `--run` is provided)
* `--size-out=FD` - set the file descriptor to write the number (in ASCII) of bytes generated by the assembler to.
* `-r`, `--run` - If given, the program will assemble the code, then immediately execute it. All parameters following this flag are sent to the program as runtime arguments.
