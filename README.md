# DefAssembler
DefAssembler is a real-time x86-64 assembler written in JavaScript. It aims to be relatively lightweight, easy to use, and efficient. For a quick demonstration, I recommend checking out the [GitHub Pages site](https://newdefectus.github.io/defAsm/). DefAssembler is also the assembler used by [Code Golf](https://code.golf/ng/fizz-buzz#assembly).

DefAssembler is available in two npm packages, `@defasm/core` and `@defasm/codemirror`, both of which are developed under this repository. `@defasm/core` is the main package, and it comes with a command-line utility that can be used to assemble and execute files. `@defasm/codemirror` is a collection of [CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net/6/) plugins which demonstrate the assembler's real-time editing capabilities. See each package's respective README file for more information.

For development, clone this repository and run `npm install`. Run `npm run dev` to open the demo on port 8000 (uses esbuild's watch feature, so you should refresh after making changes in the code). `npm test` runs the test suite (currently quite small; contributions are welcome!).
